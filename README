Bugs:
I don't think multi channel actually works... haven't bothered checking


Features:
-responds to !kitty and kitty! with a tinyurl link to a Flickr image with the tag kitty and the title of the image
-responds to !die if your nick is tahnok (you can change that)
-has a buggy !geoip command that attemps to map the hostname/ip of whomever just said !geoip
-has an avatar mode. If your nick is tahnok (you can also change that) it will write what you priv msg it to the main channel
-every 4 hours it posts a random kitty
